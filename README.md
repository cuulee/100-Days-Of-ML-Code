# 100-Days-Of-ML-Code

**"100 Days of Machine Learning Code Challenge"** proposed by [Siraj Raval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQMBj1cWPo&vl=en)

[Spanish](https://github.com/dloperab/100-Days-Of-ML-Code/blob/master/README_ES.md)

## Day 1, 2, 3: Sep 10, 11, 12/2018

**Progress:** It starts and progresses in the course of [Machine Learning Applied with Python](https://platzi.com/clases/scikit/) by [Platzi](https://platzi.com). The following chapters are finalized:

1. Introduction
2. How to define a Machine Learning problem
3. The Machine Learning engineering cycle
4. Set up a Pydata enviroment
5. Data preparation
6. Modeling and evaluation

**Thoughts:**

1. The concepts of preprocessing and dataset features visualization are more clear.
2. Functionalities of the libraries **numpy**, **pandas**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn** and **scikit-learn** are known.
3. The Lasso regression model is known and applied.

## Day 4: Sep 13/2018

**Progress:**

1. I finished Feature Engineering chapter from [Machine Learning Aplicado con Python](https://platzi.com/clases/scikit/) course by [Platzi](https://platzi.com).
2. I watched [ML.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/apps/machine-learning-and-ai/ml-dotnet) sessions from [Microsoft DotNetConf 2018](https://www.dotnetconf.net/) conference.

**Thoughts:**

1. I learned feature engineering techniques to apply to datasets like: reduction, transformation, scaling and binary encoding..
2. I can look to [ML.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/apps/machine-learning-and-ai/ml-dotnet)  like a development framework growing fast and in a midterm it can help me develop business apps combined with ML. I like this idea...I have to start trying it.

2. [Machine Learning in .NET (ML.NET)](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/dotnetConf/2018/S201)
3. [Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Every .NET Developer](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/dotnetConf/2018/S202)

## Day 5: Sep 14/2018

**Progress:**

1. I finished [Machine Learning Aplicado con Python](https://platzi.com/clases/scikit/) course by [Platzi](https://platzi.com).
2. The basic concepts of ML are reviewed again by reading blogs.

**Details:**

1. Validation methods (Cross validation, validation curves and learning curves) and model evaluations for Decision trees with con Ensembles and Grid Search are studied.
2. When studying again the basic concepts of ML like its applications and algorithms, it is always good to help to understand in a better way the different concepts in which it has been deepening.

## Day 6: Sep 15/2018

**Progress:**

I assisted to a local event in my city about [Data Science & Artificial Neural Networks](https://www.meetup.com/Python-Cali/events/254454270/) hosted by [Python Cali](https://www.pythoncali.com/)
