## Day 1, 2, 3: Sep 10, 11, 12/2018

**Progress:** It starts and progresses in the course of [Machine Learning Applied with Python](https://platzi.com/clases/scikit/) by [Platzi](https://platzi.com). The following chapters are finalized:

1. Introduction
2. How to define a Machine Learning problem
3. The Machine Learning engineering cycle
4. Set up a Pydata enviroment
5. Data preparation
6. Modeling and evaluation

**Thoughts:**

1. The concepts of preprocessing and dataset features visualization are more clear.
2. Functionalities of the libraries **numpy**, **pandas**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn** and **scikit-learn** are known.
3. The Lasso regression model is known and applied.

## Day 4: Sep 13/2018

**Progress:**

1. I finished Feature Engineering chapter from [Machine Learning Aplicado con Python](https://platzi.com/clases/scikit/) course by [Platzi](https://platzi.com).
2. I watched [ML.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/apps/machine-learning-and-ai/ml-dotnet) sessions from [Microsoft DotNetConf 2018](https://www.dotnetconf.net/) conference.

**Thoughts:**

1. I learned feature engineering techniques to apply to datasets like: reduction, transformation, scaling and binary encoding..
2. I can look to [ML.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/apps/machine-learning-and-ai/ml-dotnet)  like a development framework growing fast and in a midterm it can help me develop business apps combined with ML. I like this idea...I have to start trying it.
