## Day 1, 2, 3: Sep 10, 11, 12/2018

**Progress:** It starts and progresses in the course of [Machine Learning Applied with Python](https://platzi.com/clases/scikit/) by [Platzi](https://platzi.com). The following chapters are finalized:

1. Introduction
2. How to define a Machine Learning problem
3. The Machine Learning engineering cycle
4. Set up a Pydata enviroment
5. Data preparation
6. Modeling and evaluation

**Thoughts:**

1. The concepts of preprocessing and dataset features visualization are more clear.
2. Functionalities of the libraries **numpy**, **pandas**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn** and **scikit-learn** are known.
3. The Lasso regression model is known and applied.
